<blockquote><font size="-1">
Most search engines return a lot of unwanted
                  information. A more thorough filtering process can
                  be performed on this information to sort out the
                  relevant documents. A new method called Frequency
                  Domain Scoring (FDS), which is based on the Fourier
                  Transform is proposed.  FDS performs the filtering
                  by examining the locality of the keywords throughout
                  the documents. This is examined and compared to the
                  well known techniques Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)
                  and Cosine measure.  We found that FDS obtains
                  better results of how relevant the document is to
                  the query. The other two methods (cosine measure,
                  LSI) do not perform as well mainly because they need
                  a wider variety of documents to determine the
                  topic.
