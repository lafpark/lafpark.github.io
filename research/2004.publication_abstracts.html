<blockquote><font size="-1">
 Latent semantic retrieval methods (unlike vector
                  space methods) take the document and query vectors
                  and map them into a topic space to cluster related
                  terms and documents. This produces a more precise
                  retrieval but also a long query time. We present a
                  new method of document retrieval which allows us to
                  process the latent semantic information into a
                  hybrid latent semantic-vector space query
                  mapping. This mapping automatically expands the
                  users query based on the latent semantic information
                  in the document set. This expanded query is
                  processed using a fast vector space method. Since we
                  have the latent semantic data in a mapping, we are
                  able to store and retrieve vector information in the
                  same fast manner that the vector space method
                  offers. Multiple mappings are combined to produce
                  hybrid latent semantic retrieval which provide
                  precision results 5% greater than the vector space
                  method and fast query times.

 Fourier domain scoring : A novel document ranking method.

 Current document retrieval methods use a vector
                  space similarity measure to give scores of relevance
                  to documents when related to a specific query. The
                  central problem with these methods is that they
                  neglect any spatial information within the documents
                  in question. We present a new method called Fourier
                  Domain Scoring (FDS) which takes advantage of this
                  spatial information, via the Fourier transform, to
                  give a more accurate ordering of relevance to a
                  document set. We show that FDS gives an improvement
                  in precision over the vector space similarity
                  measures for the common case of Web like queries,
                  and it gives similar results to the vector space
                  measures for longer queries.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The information found on the Internet is growing at
                  such a rapid rate that soon methods of
                  searching through text using terms frequencies will
                  not be enough. At the moment, many Web search
                  engines are showing signs of imprecision because
                  they are based on these term counting methods which
                  do not examine the relationships between the
                  document terms. These methods begin to fail as the
                  number of indexed documents increases past an
                  allowable limit.  Natural language processing has
                  been performed in the past and we have found that it
                  is only useful within its own domain. For example,
                  if we use a natural language system to extract
                  documents from a sporting database, we will find
                  that the same tool will not be very effective for
                  medical articles.  Spatial methods have been
                  developed to tackle the problem of the ever growing
                  World Wide Web. Many have failed but a few have
                  risen to the level of the frequency based methods
                  mentioned above. Due to the extra document analysis
                  performed, the spatial methods are slower than the
                  frequency based methods and require more storage.
                  This thesis presents a novel method of information
                  retrieval entitled &ldquo;Spectral Information
                  Retrieval&rdquo;. This method achieves the speed of the
                  vector space methods with the benefits of the
                  proximity methods to provide an overall high quality
                  information retrieval system. Rather than using the
                  spatial locality information (used in proximity
                  searches), a spectral information retrieval method
                  utilises the query terms' spectral lo- cality
                  information (found with the aid of either the
                  Fourier transform, Cosine transform, Gaussian
                  transform or Wavelet transform). By combining the
                  query term spectra, we are able to make fast
                  proximity calculations and also make use of the many
                  varieties of vec- tor space method weighting
                  schemes. This method provides superior results to
                  existing text based information retrieval systems.
                  It is shown that spectral information retrieval
                  methods provide high precision results at query
                  times comparable to the widely used vector space
                  methods, when using an index of comparable size to a
                  vector space method index. This was possible using
                  com- pression techniques such as spectral component
                  cropping and quantisation, and speed up techniques
                  such as early termination. When querying with a
                  small set of terms, we saw that the spectral
                  document retrieval methods using a certain vector
                  space method weighting scheme, always improved the
                  precision of the vector space method by a sig-
                  nificant margin (at least 10%).  It is also shown
                  that the spectral information retrieval system can
                  be further enhanced when working in conjunction with
                  a relevance feedback system.
