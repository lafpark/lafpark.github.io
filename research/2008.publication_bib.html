  abstract = {Rank-Biased Precision (RBP) is a retrieval
                  evaluation metric that assigns an effectiveness
                  score to a ranking by computing a geometricly
                  weighted sum of document relevance values, with the
                  monotonicly decreasing weights in the geometric
                  distribution determined via a persistence
                  parameter p. Despite exhibiting various
                  advantageous traits over well known existing
                  measures such as Average Precision, RBP has the
                  drawback of requiring the designer of any experiment
                  to choose a value for p. Here we present a method
                  that allows retrieval systems evaluated using RBP
                  with different p values to be compared. The proposed
                  approach involves calculating two critical
                  bounding relevance vectors for the original RBP
                  score, and using those vectors to calculate the
                  range of possible RBP scores for any other value of
                  p. Those bounds may then be sufficient to allow the
                  outright superiority of one system over the other to
                  be established. In addition, the process can be
                  modified to handle any RBP residuals associated with
                  either of the two systems. We believe the adoption
                  of the comparison process described in this paper
                  will greatly aid the uptake of RBP in evaluation
                  experiments.},

  abstract = {Web page prefetching has been used efficiently to
                  reduce the access latency problem of the Internet,
                  its success mainly relies on the accuracy of Web
                  page prediction.  As powerful sequential learning
                  models, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have been
                  used successfully to improve the Web page prediction
                  accuracy when the total number of unique Web pages
                  is small. However, because the training complexity
                  of CRFs is quadratic to the number of labels, when
                  applied to a website with a large number of unique
                  pages, the training of CRFs may become very slow and
                  even intractable. In this paper, we decrease the
                  training time and computational resource
                  requirements of CRFs training by integrating error
                  correcting output coding (ECOC) method.  Moreover,
                  since the performance of ECOC-based methods
                  crucially depends on the ECOC code matrix in use, we
                  employ a coding method, Search Coding, to design the
                  code matrix of good quality.},

  abstract = {Web page prefetching is used to reduce the access
                  latency of th`e Internet. However, if most
                  prefetched Web pages are not visited by the users in
                  their subsequent accesses, the limited network
                  bandwidth and server resources will not be used
                  efficiently and even worsen the access delay
                  problem. Therefore, enhancing the Web page
                  prediction accuracy is a main problem of Web page
                  prefetching. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which
                  are popular sequential learning models, have already
                  been successfully used for many Natural Language
                  Processing (NLP) tasks such as POS tagging, name
                  entity recognition (NER) and segmentation. In this
                  paper, we propose the use of CRFs in the field of
                  Web page prediction. We treat the accessing sessions
                  of previous Web users as observation sequences and
                  label each element of these observation sequences to
                  get the corresponding label sequences, then based on
                  these observation and label sequences we use CRFs to
                  train a prediction model and predict the probable
                  subsequent Web pages for the current users. Our
                  experimental results show that CRFs can produce
                  higher Web page prediction accuracy effectively when
                  compared with other popular techniques like plain
                  Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).},

  abstract = {Language modelling is new form of information
                  retrieval that is rapidly becoming the preferred
                  choice over probabilistic and vector space models,
                  due to the intuitiveness of the model formulation
                  and its effectiveness. The language model assumes
                  that all terms are independent, therefore the
                  majority of the documents returned to the user will
                  be those that contain the query terms. By making
                  this assumption, related documents that do not
                  contain the query terms will never be found, unless
                  the related terms are introduced into the query
                  using a query expansion technique. Unfortunately,
                  recent attempts at performing a query expansion
                  using a language model have not been in-line with
                  the language model, being complex and not intuitive
                  to the user. In this article, we introduce a simple
                  method of query expansion using the naive Bayes
                  assumption, that is in-line with the language model
                  since it is derived from the language model. We show
                  how to derive the query expansion term relationships
                  using probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA).
                  Through experimentation, we show that using PLSA
                  query expansion within the language model framework,
                  we can provide a significant increase in precision.},

  abstract = {A latent semantic thesaurus allows us to use the
                  term relationships generated by probabilistic latent
                  semantic analysis (PLSA) in the form of a query
                  expansion. It has many benefits over a latent
                  semantic index; one of them being that the weights
                  used to calculate the thesaurus term relationships
                  can be different to the weights used during document
                  retrieval.  This article contains an investigation
                  of the effect of term weighting on the probabilistic
                  latent semantic term relationships. The effect of
                  the term weighting is examined through the precision
                  obtained from queries using the PLSA term
                  relationships.  Through experimentation, we found
                  that all but one of the document sets used produced
                  more effective term relationships when using
                  weighted document-term frequencies, bringing us to
                  the conclusion that it is more likely that term
                  relationships will be more effective when using
                  weighted terms with PLSA.  A comparison to the BM25
                  pseudo-relevance feedback retrieval system showed
                  that the PLSA weighted thesaurus method was able to
                  produce an average 9\% increase in average
                  reciprocal rank.  },
