  abstract = { Search effectiveness metrics are used to evaluate
                  the quality of the answer lists returned by search
                  services, usually based on a set of relevance
                  judgments. One plausible way of calculating an
                  effectiveness score for a system run is to compute
                  the inner-product of the run's relevance
                  vector and a ``utility'' vector, where
                  the ith element in the utility vector represents the
                  relative benefit obtained by the user of the system
                  if they encounter a relevant document at depth i in
                  the ranking. This paper uses such a framework to
                  examine the user behavior patterns-and hence
                  utility weightings-that can be inferred from
                  a web query log. We describe a process for
                  extrapolating user observations from query log
                  clickthroughs, and employ this user model to measure
                  the quality of effectiveness weighting
                  distributions. Our results show that for measures
                  with static distributions (that is, utility
                  weighting schemes for which the weight vector is
                  independent of the relevance vector), the geometric
                  weighting model employed in the rank-biased
                  precision effectiveness metric offers the closest
                  fit to the user observation model. In addition,
                  using past TREC data as to indicate likelihood of
                  relevance, we also show that the distributions
                  employed in the BPref and MRR metrics are the best
                  fit out of the measures for which static
                  distributions do not exist.},
