Web page prefetching techniques are used to
                  address the access latency problem of the
                  Internet. To perform successful prefetching, we must
                  be able to predict the next set of pages that will
                  be accessed by users. The PageRank algorithm used by
                  Google is able to compute the popularity of a set of
                  Web pages based on their link structure. In this
                  paper, a novel PageRank-like algorithm is proposed
                  for conducting Web page predction. Two biasing
                  factors are adopted to personalize PageRank, so that
                  it favors the pages that are more important to
                  users. One factor is the length of time spent on
                  visiting a page and the other is the frequency that
                  a page was visited. The experiments conducted show
                  that using these two factors simultaneously to bias
                  PageRank results in more accurate Web page
                  prediction than other methods that use only one of
                  these two factors.

 Mining web multi-resolution community-based popularity for
  information retrieval.
 In <em>The Proceedings of the 2007 ACM Conference on Information and
  Knowledge Management</em>, pages 545--552, November 2007.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The PageRank algorithm is used in Web information
                  retrieval to calculate a single list of popularity
                  scores for each page in the Web. These popularity
                  scores are used to rank query results when presented
                  to the user. By using the structure of the entire
                  Web to calculate one score per document, we are
                  calculating a general popularity score, not
                  particular to any community. Therefore, the PageRank
                  scores are more suited to general queries. In this
                  paper, we introduce a more general form of PageRank,
                  using Web multi-resolution community-based
                  popularity scores, where each document obtains a
                  popularity score dependent on a given Web
                  community. When a query is related to a specific
                  community, we choose the associated set of
                  popularity scores and order the query results
                  accordingly. Using Web-community based popularity
                  scores, we achieved an 11% increase in precision
                  over PageRank.

 Query expansion using a collection dependent probabilistic latent

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Many queries on collections of text documents are
                  too short to produce informative results. Automatic
                  query expansion is a method of adding terms to the
                  query without interaction from the user in order to
                  obtain more refined results. In this investigation,
                  we examine our novel automatic query expansion
                  method using the probabilistic latent semantic
                  thesaurus, which is based on probabilistic latent
                  semantic analysis. We show how to construct the
                  thesaurus by mining text documents for probabilistic
                  term relationships, and we show that by using the
                  latent semantic thesaurus, we can overcome many of
                  the problems associated to latent semantic analysis
                  on large document sets which were previously
                  identified. Experiments using TREC document sets
                  show that our term expansion method out performs the
                  popular probabilistic pseudo-relevance feedback
                  method by 7.3%.

 On the distribution of user persistence for rank-biased precision.
 In <em>The Proceedings of the Twelfth Australasian Document
  Computing Symposium</em>, 2007.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
 Rank-biased precision (RBP) is a new method of
                  information retrieval system evaluation that takes
                  into account any uncertainty due to incomplete
                  relevance judgements for a given document and query
                  set. To do so, RBP uses a model of user persistence.
                  In this article, we will present a statistical
                  analysis of the RBP user persistence model to
                  observe how the user persistence value affects the
                  user persistence distribution. We also provide a
                  method of fitting data from existing users to the
                  persistence model, in order to compute their
                  persistence value. Using the Microsoft MSN query
                  log, we were able to demonstrate a typical
                  distribution of the user persistence value and show
                  that it closely resembles a reverse lognormal
                  distribution, with a mean of p = 0.78.
