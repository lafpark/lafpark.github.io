  abstract = { The vector space model (VSM) of information
                  retrieval suf- fers in two areas, it does not
                  utilise term positions and it treats every term as
                  being independent. We examine two information
                  retrieval meth- ods based on the simple vector space
                  model. The first uses the query term position flow
                  within the documents to calculate the document
                  score, the second includes related terms in the
                  query by making use of term corre- lations. Both of
                  these methods show significant improvements over the
                  VSM precision while keeping the query time to speeds
                  similar to those of the VSM.  },

  abstract = {Current information retrieval methods either
                  ignore the term positions or deal with exact term
                  positions; the former can be seen as coarse document
                  resolution, the latter as fine document reso-
                  lution. We propose a new spectral-based information
                  retrieval method that is able to utilize many
                  different levels of document resolution by examining
                  the term patterns that occur in the documents.  To
                  do this, we take advantage of the multiresolution
                  analysis properties of the wavelet transform.  We
                  show that we are able to achieve higher precision
                  when compared to vector space and proximity
                  retrieval methods, while producing fast query times
                  and using a compact index.  },
