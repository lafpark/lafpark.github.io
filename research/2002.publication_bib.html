  abstract = {Fourier Domain Scoring (FDS) has been shown to give a 60\%
                  improvement in precision over the existing vector
                  space methods, but its index requires a large
                  storage space. We propose a new Web text mining
                  method using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to
                  extract use- ful information from text documents and
                  to provide improved document ranking, without having
                  to store excessive data. While the new method
                  preserves the performance of the FDS method, it
                  gives a 40\% improve- ment in precision over the
                  established text mining methods when using only 20\%
                  of the storage space required by FDS.},

  abstract = {The traditional methods of spectral text retrieval
                  (FDS,CDS) create an index of spatial data and
                  convert the data to its spectral form at query
                  time. We present a new method of implementing and
                  querying an index containing spectral data which
                  will conserve the high precision performance of the
                  spectral methods, reduce the time needed to resolve
                  the query, and maintain an acceptable size for the
                  index. This is done by taking advantage of the
                  properties of the discrete cosine transform and by
                  applying ideas from vector space document ranking
                  methods.},
