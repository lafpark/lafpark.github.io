the probability of a query being related to the document. The majority
of document models are functions of the terms that appear within the
document. This implies that a query is only relevant to a document if
the query terms exist within the document, which is far from the

<p>In our project, we have created a new form of document model called, a
Relevance-based document model, which is built based on the relevance
of each query to the document and not the words that appear within the
document. Relevance-based document models are constructed using a set
of queries and the associated relevance of the query to the document
(shown in Fig. 6). This information allows us to construct a model
that provides 100% precision results for the known queries and large
improvements in precision over document content-based models for
partially known queries. Since the relevance-based document models are
based only on the query terms and their relevance to a document, the
time required to build the models is very fast and the storage
required to store the model is very compact.</p>
<p>To date, we have performed extensive experiments showing the behaviour
of our relevance-based document models under difference
circumstances. Our experiments have shown that by mixing the document
content-based model with our relevance based document model, we are
able to provide high precision results using low storage and fast
query times.</p>
